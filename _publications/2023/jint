  In this paper, we introduce the convex uncertain Voronoi (CUV) diagram, a generalization of the standard Voronoi diagram that accounts for the uncertain pose of each individual robot. 
  We then use the CUV diagram to develop distributed multi-target tracking and coverage control algorithms that enable teams of mobile robots to account for bounded uncertainty in the location of each robot.
