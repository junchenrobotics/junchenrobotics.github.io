  In this paper we address this problem by introducing four new distributed algorithms that allow large teams of robots to: i) run the prediction and ii) update steps of a distributed recursive Bayesian multi- target tracker, iii) determine the set of local neighbors that must exchange data, and iv) exchange data in a consistent manner.
