  This paper introduces the normalized unused sensing capacity to measure the amount of information that a sensor is currently gathering relative to its theoretical maximum. This is then used to develop a distributed coverage control strategy for a team of heterogeneous sensors that automatically balances the load based on the current unused capacity of each team member.
